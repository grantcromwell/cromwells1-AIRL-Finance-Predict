## ICT Trading Concepts Explained

### 1. Buy-Side and Sell-Side Liquidity

**Buy-Side Liquidity (Demand Zones):**
- Areas where large clusters of buy orders reside (typically below current price)
- Represented by previous swing lows and consolidation areas
- Smart money targets these zones to fill large sell positions
- **Identification:** Price levels with 2+ touches and volume confirmation

**Sell-Side Liquidity (Supply Zones):**
- Areas where large clusters of sell orders reside (typically above current price)
- Represented by previous swing highs and consolidation areas
- Smart money targets these zones to fill large buy positions
- **Identification:** Price levels with 2+ touches and volume confirmation

**Trading Application:**
- Price is magnetically drawn to liquidity zones
- Identifying these zones helps predict price targets
- **Liquidity sweeps:** Price temporarily moves through a level to access orders, then reverses
- Use sweeps as high-probability entry signals with confirmation

### 2. Order Flow Trading

**Order Flow:** The sequence of buy and sell orders entering the market, revealing the aggressiveness of buyers vs sellers.

**Order Blocks:** Large institutional orders that leave "footprints" on the chart:
- **Bullish Order Block:** Strong up candle (body/range > 0.6) followed by consolidation and continuation up
- **Bearish Order Block:** Strong down candle (body/range > 0.6) followed by consolidation and continuation down
- Entry on retest of the order block zone
- Stop loss beyond the opposite side of the block

**Imbalances (Fair Value Gaps - FVG):**
- Price gaps indicating aggressive buying or selling
- **Bullish FVG:** Gap between candle 1's high and candle 3's low in upward move
- **Bearish FVG:** Gap between candle 1's low and candle 3's high in downward move
- Price often returns to fill these gaps (mean reversion)

**Order Flow Metrics:**
- **Delta:** Difference between aggressive buyers and sellers (-1 to +1)
- **Buying Pressure:** Strong up candles closing near highs
- **Selling Pressure:** Strong down candles closing near lows
- **Absorption:** Volume increases but price range decreases (liquidity exhaustion)

### 3. FM DOM Trading (Depth of Market Analysis)

**DOM (Depth of Market):** Shows pending buy and sell orders at different price levels.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Absorption:** Large orders absorbing available liquidity
  - Signs: Volume spikes, range contraction, rejection wicks
  - Indicates potential reversal (liquidity exhausted)

- **Exhaustion:** Liquidity running out, leading to reversals
  - Occurs after strong directional moves
  - Confirmed by divergence between volume and price

- **Delta Analysis:**
  - Positive delta: More aggressive buyers (bullish)
  - Negative delta: More aggressive sellers (bearish)
  - Neutral delta: Balance between buyers and sellers (consolidation)

### 4. ICT Macro Time Zone Trading

**Kill Zones:** High-probability trading times when institutional activity peaks:

| Kill Zone | Time (EST) | Market Session | Volatility | Best For |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Asian Session | 5pm-12am | Tokyo/Singapore | 0.6x | Accumulation, position building |
| London Open KZ | 2am-5am | London open | 1.2x | Breakout trades, trend initiation |
| London Session | 3am-11am | European hours | 1.0x | Trend following, momentum |
| NY Open KZ | 8am-11am | NY market open | 1.5x | **Highest probability**, breakouts |
| NY Session | 8am-4pm | US market hours | 1.3x | Intraday swings, news events |

**Kill Zone Trading Strategy:**
1. **Identify the Asian session range** (highs and lows from 5pm-12am EST)
2. **London breakout (2am-5am):** Trade breakouts of Asian range
3. **NY open (8am-11am):** Highest volatility, best entries
4. **Overlap (8am-11am):** London + NY overlap, strongest moves

## Practical Trading Rules - ICT Concepts

### Rule 1: Liquidity Zone Identification

**Buy-Side Liquidity (Support) Detection:**
1. Find previous swing lows (price reversals from downward to upward)
2. Count touches (minimum 2 touches for valid zone)
3. Confirm with volume spikes at those levels
4. Strength score increases with touches and volume

**Sell-Side Liquidity (Resistance) Detection:**
1. Find previous swing highs (price reversals from upward to downward)
2. Count touches (minimum 2 touches for valid zone)
3. Confirm with volume spikes at those levels
4. Stronger zones have more touches and higher volume

**Trading Application:**
- Draw horizontal lines at these levels
- Expect price to be drawn to these zones
- Use zones as entry points or targets

### Rule 2: Entry Signals

**Order Block Entry:**
1. Identify last strong directional candle before consolidation
   - Bullish OB: Strong up candle, body > 60% of range, high volume
   - Bearish OB: Strong down candle, body > 60% of range, high volume
2. Wait for price to return to the order block zone
3. Enter on retest with confirmation
4. Stop loss beyond the opposite side of the OB

**Liquidity Sweep Entry:**
1. Price moves through a liquidity zone
2. Close back outside the zone (rejection)
3. Upper/lower wick > body size (strong rejection)
4. Enter in direction of the rejection
5. Stop loss beyond the swing point

**Kill Zone Entry:**
1. Identify Asian session range (5pm-12am EST)
2. London breakout (2am-5am): Trade breakouts of Asian range
3. NY open (8am-11am): Trade first 30-minute candle direction
4. Confirm with order flow (delta alignment)

### Rule 3: Trade Management

**Stop Loss Placement:**
- Beyond the liquidity zone (not right at the level)
- For longs: Below swing low by 1-2%
- For shorts: Above swing high by 1-2%
- Adjust based on volatility (wider stops for volatile assets)

**Take Profit Targets:**
- Primary: Opposite liquidity zone
- Secondary: 1:2 risk-reward minimum
- Trail stop once 1:1 reached
- Take partial profits at intermediate levels

**Position Sizing:**
- Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
- Calculate position size based on stop loss distance
- Reduce size for wider stops
- Increase size only when system proves profitable

### Rule 4: Confirmation Checklist

Before entering any trade, confirm:

- [ ] **Liquidity Zone:** Price is near a valid support/resistance level
- [ ] **Order Flow:** Delta aligns with trade direction (> 0.2 or < -0.2)
- [ ] **Order Block:** Order block present at entry level
- [ ] **Kill Zone:** Entering during optimal time window
- [ ] **Risk-Reward:** Minimum 1:2 ratio
- [ ] **Confluence:** Multiple factors align (zone + OB + time + flow)
- [ ] **No Negative News:** Check for earnings, Fed meetings, etc.
- [ ] **Position Size:** Calculated based on 1-2% risk

**Never enter if:** More than 2 confirmation items are missing.

### Rule 5: Exit Strategy

**Take Profits:**
- 50% at 1:1 risk-reward (lock in profits)
- 25% at 1:2 risk-reward
- 25% let run to target

**Stop Loss Management:**
- Move to breakeven after 1:1 reached
- Trail below/above swing lows/highs
- Never widen stop loss

**When to Exit Early:**
- Liquidity sweep with strong rejection
- Order flow reversal (delta changes sign)
- Target reached ahead of schedule
- News event creating volatility
